# Day Zero

Welcome to Day Zero, a simple and minimalistic portfolio website created using plain HTML and CSS.

## Overview

This project represents "Day Zero" of my portfolio journey, where I decided to go back to the basics and create a personal website using only HTML and CSS. It showcases my projects and serves as a creative space for experimentation.

## Features

- Clean and minimalistic design
- Responsive layout
- Project list with links and descriptions
- Sources and references section

## Getting Started

To view the website locally, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fausto022/faustos-abstract.git
```
Then, I'm using VS Code's _Live Server_ extension to get it running.  
Future versions of this project will be hosted (once I learn how to do so)
